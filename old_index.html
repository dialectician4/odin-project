    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Some par.</p>
    <h2>Second Level Header</h2>
    <h3>2 Alternative ways of configuring a grammar for HTML:</h3>
    <h4>1. Strict Grammar:</h4>
    <p>Strict grammar would preserve or enforce the ordering of headers</p>
    <p>i.e. S1 -> h1 S2 h1 S3</p>
    <p>
      where sibling elements to (h1) can only be generated through S3, and S3's
      set excludes h1 (while S1 it's parent included h1). Likewise for all other
      hn's.
    </p>
    <h5>2. Weak Grammar:</h5>
    <p>
      Weak grammar would be valid HTML that can be parsed but wouldn't preserve
      semantic content which we would <em>like</em> to preserve as end users,
    </p>
    <p>i.e. S1 -> h1 S2 h1 S1</p>
    <p>
      Which would be validly parsable HTML <strong>I THINK</strong> but which
      could fail to preserve heading information potentially (take the following
      set of only start html tags: h1 h3 h2 h1 h1 h5)
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of those ordering issues would prolly be excluded from the Strong
      Grammar through further determination of the Child Node S2 moreso than by
      replacing generated S1 with restricted S3
    </p>
    <p>I <em>think</em> for</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Now we're making</li>
      <li>Lists for no</li>
      <li>Real reason</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Now actually</li>
      <li>List items are</li>
      <li>Generated with the same `li` tag</li>
      <li>Regardless of if the list is ordered (ol)</li>
      <li>Unordered (ul)</li>
    </ol>
